## 3. Report on Two Gelatin Meteorite Falls by Dr. Otto Hahn in Reutlingen.

According to previous observations there are eight falls of gelatin meteorites on record, among them is one from the year 1828 or 1829 (from Allport Derbyshire) whose analysis revealed 32.00% sulfur, 34.09% iron oxide, and 43.59% coal and specific gravity 2. The remaining cases did not get an investigation, however they were witnessed by quite credible people. All are compiled by [Georg Heinrich von] Boguslawski, from which Dr. Otto Ule (_The Wonder of the Starry World [sic], 2nd Edition_ with D. Klein, page 360 and the following pages) has again described the most important eight cases mentioned.

The falls are similar to each other and, as soon as they can be supposed as completely proven, excite the highest interest because of their peculiar chemical composition. Up till now, however, science has not admitted absolute certainty. I therefore consider it necessary to also communicate just two additional, more likely than not, falls; two falls which totally correspond with Boguslawski and one which furthermore has a special strangeness: for it is the only observed meteorite fall in Württemberg.

Both falls are reported by persons who cannot be denied their observational ability: their character also vouches in favor of their desire to tell the truth.

The plausibility of their statements, however, becomes certain simply through the content of the message itself. Both informants are not technical experts, they knew only that I was very interested in meteorites. If they had wanted to pull my leg they would, like that deceiving arctic fox grabbing the best nearby storybook, either narrate a description in accordance with what had hitherto been given, or resort to a book, and after this tell of a fire phenomenon, from there of a light phenomenon, cannon shots, small rifle crackling as accompanying the phenomenon. It is, in the highest degree, unlikely that they would have found or extracted a genuine description of this uncommon event.

In the standard textbooks and guidebooks, however, nothing is found on gelatin meteorites. Furthermore, these statements were made in such a way that preparation could hardly be possible.

So, I assume that the observed was faithfully recounted: but if it is true what they tell, then it is out of question and beyond doubt that one is really dealing with cosmic masses. 

It was certainly, however, gelatin masses that were found, which no one was able to immediately explain, for which reason one resorted to an explanation from shooting stars. Only they had a description of an entirely different kind, structureless slime masses; they were identified from detailed investigation as telluric substances. Importance cannot be attached to such stated things in the current state of science. In my reporting of the falls, based on the nature of their form, any thought of terrestrial origin, i.e. frogspawn, _Nostoc_ algae, is from the outset out of question: all accompanying circumstances are stated and the identity of the discovered, or more correctly, the observations of a truly fallen object are without doubt. An explanation in favor of such a mass upon dry grassy ground or a tree, as I am about to now communicate, does not exist.

The two falls most likely took place in the year 1848, and in fact, between the nights of the 9th and 14th of August.

The first source of mine, Mr. Müller, a mechanic in Reutlingen told me:

I was born in August 1837. My father was royal Bavarian district geometer in Ottobeuren near Memmingen, formerly accounting auditor of land surveying in Bavaria.

I attended the excellent primary school in Ottobeuren, was always first in my class and still own the first prizes, which I received during my school attendance each year, until the 14th year. In the classes we certainly learned about meteorites and shooting stars. My father, apart from being conversant with the relevant natural processes, told us about them in conversation.

I can no longer recall, in the year 1848 or 1849, I believe 1848, after the hay harvest, I was observing a very clear sky one summer evening (when the weather was still dry) and at this point saw a host of shooting stars fall. They fell in all directions. The sky became a web of crisscrossing streaks of light. I saw some individuals move at an angle, as if they had bounced off an object in the atmosphere. In the course of this many bursts of fire sprayed forth. I witnessed this phenomenon from the vicinity of this location and, in order to completely observe it, went to a small mound, a quarter of an hour from the located spot, where to the east I had seen a pine forest in the distance about a quarter of an hour below me. The hill was about as high as the peaks of the pines, I thus stood at an equal height with the pine tops.

I note that the weather had been dry for a long time; the plot of land on which I stood formed a hill, it was a meadow (with many cracks as a consequence of the dryness), the subsoil was a diluvial scree common to the whole area and upon that was an approximately one and a half feet deep layer of sand, which bore a covering of grass plants.

All of a sudden I heard hissing and whizzing across the forest (behind me) and, after listening it for two to three seconds, a fall behind me in the distance about three to four paces away. The sound was directed east, hinting towards the forest. When this action caught my attention, it was like an air-filled ox bladder had burst. Through this I heard the echo of the hissing from the forest.

I quickly turned and searched for the apparently fallen object. But since I was unable to immediately distinguish any such thing due to the darkness, I marked the spot where the fall should have occured with my stick, so that I could visit it the next day. The plot of land was our property; I would have also easily found it again without this marking because it was at the corner of the boundary that it made with the adjacent property, hence it was already sufficiently marked for me.

Bright and early the next day I went to the place and actually found, only one meter from the spot marked by the stick, a gelatin-like ball, likewise consisting of rust-colored balls. It was located on thin grass; a surface had flattened out beneath it.

The diameter of the ball was thirty centimeters.

I kicked the ball with my foot, it began a trembling motion which continued for a long time until the mass returned to its resting point with ever weakening vibrations. Now I touched it, it was sticky, but nothing of the substance stuck to the fingers, nor did its form change from the kick of the foot or the touch of the fingers.

I now come to the detailed description of the ball. It consisted of rust-colored round bodies, which lay against each other, free of any noticable sharp boundary lines.

One of these balls was four centimeters in size, the majority smaller up to two centimeters.* In the interior of the balls I noticed filamentous lines of dark, even black, color; the interstices between the balls (because they did not lie directly on each other) were filled with a dark mass and likewise had a kind of structure, such as I distinctly observed on the balls. The whole thing had roughly the appearance of a dark yellow frogspawn clump, pervaded with filaments, and just by this, plus the various sizes of the balls, made it entirely and undoubtedly different from frogspawn. The surface was slightly transparent, so that I could recognize the form of the balls as round and pear-shaped bodies.

I didn't know what to do with the thing. The clump arouse disgust in me. I left it laying there. However, I had no change of thought, that is was a meteorite [sic]. I have never, you see, seen anything of this kind on the Earth, nor have I seen anything before or after in the meadow. Even my siblings, who saw it, never remembered seeing such a thing.
