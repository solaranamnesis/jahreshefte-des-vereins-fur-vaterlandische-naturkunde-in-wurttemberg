## 3. Report on Two Gelatin Meteorite Falls by Dr. Otto Hahn in Reutlingen.

According to previous observations there are eight falls of gelatin meteorites on record, among them is one from the year 1828 or 1829 (from Allport Derbyshire) whose analysis revealed 32.00% sulfur, 34.09% iron oxide, and 43.59% coal and specific gravity 2. The remaining cases did not get an investigation, however they were witnessed by quite credible people. All are compiled by [Georg Heinrich von] Boguslawski, from which Dr. Otto Ule (_The Wonders of the Star World, 2nd Edition_ with D. Klein, page 360 and the following pages) has described again the most important eight cases mentioned.
