## 3. Report on Two Gelatin Meteorite Falls by Dr. Otto Hahn in Reutlingen.

According to previous observations there are eight falls of gelatin meteorites on record, among them is one from the year 1828 or 1829 (from Allport Derbyshire) whose analysis revealed 32.00% sulfur, 34.09% iron oxide, and 43.59% coal and specific gravity 2. The remaining cases did not get an investigation, however they were witnessed by quite credible people. All are compiled by [Georg Heinrich von] Boguslawski, from which Dr. Otto Ule (_The Wonder of the Starry World [sic], 2nd Edition_ with D. Klein, page 360 and the following pages) has described again the most important eight cases mentioned.

The falls are similar to each other and, as soon as they are supposed to be completely proven, excite the highest interest because of their peculiar chemical composition. Up till now, however, science has not admitted absolute certainty. I therefore consider it necessary to also communicate just two additional, more likely than not, falls; two falls which totally correspond with Boguslawski and one which furthermore has a special strangeness: for it is the only observed meteorite fall in WÃ¼rttemberg.

Both falls are reported by persons who cannot be denied their observational ability: their character also vouches in favor of their desire to tell the truth.

The plausibility of their statements, however, becomes certain simply through the content of the message itself. Both informants are not technical experts, they knew only that I was very interested in meteorites. If they had wanted to pull my leg they would, like that lying arctic fox reaching for the best nearby storybook, either narrate a description in accordance with what has hitherto been given, or resort to a book, and after this tell of a fire phenomenon, from there of a light phenomenon, cannon shots, small rifle crackling as accompanying the phenomenon. It is, in the highest degree, unlikely that they would have found or extracted an honest description of this uncommon event.

In the standard textbooks and guidebooks, however, nothing is found of gelatin meteorites. Furthermore, these statements were made in such a way that preparation could hardly be possible.

So, I assume that the observed was faithfully recounted: but if it is true what they tell, then it is out of question and beyond doubt that one is really dealing with cosmic masses. 

It was certainly, however, gelatin masses that were found that no one was able to immediately explain, for which reason one resorted to an explanation from shooting stars. Only they were a description of an entirely different kind, structureless slime masses; they were identified from detailed investigation as telluric substances. Importance cannot be attached to such discovered things in the current state of science. In my reporting of the falls, based on the nature of their form, any thought of terrestrial origin, i.e. frogspawn, _Nostoc_ algae, is from the outset out of question: all accompanying circumstances are stated and the identity of the discovered, or more correctly, the observations of a truly fallen object are without doubt. An explanation in favor of such a mass upon dry grassy ground or a tree, as I am about to now communicate, does not exist.

The two falls most likely took place in the year 1848, and in fact, between the nights of the 9th and 14th of August.
